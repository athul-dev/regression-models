Hi guys !!

What I have done here is a simple linear regression model with some solid math involved rather than 
directly using the sckit library, we could also remove numpy and use the relevant math operations as numpy is used here
mainly to do the array cum math computations.

We could use this model to any dataset to obtain a linear regression best fit line.

Please feel free do commit and improve on it.Lets make it a library free model.

Thanks guys.
